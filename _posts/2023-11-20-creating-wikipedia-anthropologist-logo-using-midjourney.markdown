title:  "Creating Wikipedia Anthropologist Logo Using Midjourney"
---

Now that I have a React site up and running with a few tables of interesting Wikipedia data being displayed, it's time to make it look serious, but in a silly way!

**Prompt**
I searched the gallery for logos, I saw one I liked and googled 'anthropologist hat' to find out the one I had in mind is called a Pith Helmet hat.

`/imagine prompt:simple round travel stamp showing the wikipedia logo wearing a Pith Helmet hat, vector style, black and white, white background`

I like the third one. If only it showed anything to do with Wikipedia.... 

**Prompt**

I took more inspo from the gallery, this prompt was for a fake university course. I tweaked it for mine.

`/imagine prompt:Ironic logo of online researcher "Wikipedia Antrhopologist", futuristic, meta-irony, meta-humor, modern, stylish, minimalist, quasi-university --style raw --v 5.2`

![second generation]({{ site.url }}/github-pages-with-docker/assets/images/wikipedia-anthropologist-logo/w-a-prompt-2

I like this first one, especially the W logo. Let's get some more versions of it

We lost the W logo... gonna try to get it back

**Prompt**

`/imagine prompt:Ironic logo for online researcher with the text "Wikipedia Antrhopologist", futuristic, meta-irony, meta-humor, modern, stylish, minimalist, vector style, quasi-university`

![third generation]({{ site.url }}/github-pages-with-docker/assets/images/wikipedia-anthropologist-logo/w-a-prompt-3

I'm annoyed that AI can't spell right. But I should be leading from the front here and fix my `Antrhopologist` misspelling

Gonna go real simple this time.

**Prompt**
`/imagine prompt:minimalist logo with an anthropologist at a wikipedia laptop`

I love where this is going but I want it to be as simple as the first batch. 

**Prompt**
`/imagine prompt:minimalist logo with an anthropologist at a wikipedia laptop, vector style, black and white, white background`

![fifth generation]({{ site.url }}/github-pages-with-docker/assets/images/wikipedia-anthropologist-logo/w-a-prompt-5

Ok, maybe that's a little too simple. Let's complexify it and move it to the desert

**Prompt**
`/imagine prompt:minimalist logo of an anthropologist in the desert at a wikipedia laptop, vector style, black and white, white background`

![sixth generation]({{ site.url }}/github-pages-with-docker/assets/images/wikipedia-anthropologist-logo/w-a-prompt-6

I like the last one there, lets get some more versions

![seventh generation]({{ site.url }}/github-pages-with-docker/assets/images/wikipedia-anthropologist-logo/w-a-prompt-7
.png)

Now I just want to create scenes of researchers at laptops all over the world

**Prompt**
`/imagine prompt:Minimalist logo of an archeologist on top of a mayan pyramid with a wikipedia laptop, vector styled`

![eigth generation]({{ site.url }}/github-pages-with-docker/assets/images/wikipedia-anthropologist-logo/w-a-prompt-8
.png)

**Prompt**
`/imagine prompt:minimalist logo of an archeologist at a laptop in the jungle `

While none of these are suitable for favicons... there are quite a few gems in here so I'll probably set aside some space on the navbar and cycle through some of these. I'll link to it once it's up!
